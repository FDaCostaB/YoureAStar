# CrowdSimulation- Group 7A - You're A Star
One of the most used algorithms in games is the A* algorithm. Even when you create an efficient implementation, applying this algorithm on a crowd of 100K+ agents to plan a global path in a big environment (of say 25 squared kilometers) may prove to be too costly. Be a star, and design and implement a variant that is fast enough to work in huge environments with huge crowds.
